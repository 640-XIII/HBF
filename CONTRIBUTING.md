## How to contribute

Although this is a hobby project i would love to get some help and if you want to help you can do it freely but <u><b>keep this in mind</b></u>

><ol>
><li>Do not mess with the INSTRUCTION_LENGTH</li>
><li>Keep it simple, you can do whatever you want with a copy of HBF</li>
><li>If you have any new ideas for commands i will see the new commands in action and then decide if they fit the theme of HBF</li>
></ol>

## Are there any ways to help with HBF ?

Yes, you can do it with with the Issues tab to let me know with any bugs you might encounter or you can suggest ways to improve
the README.md file for example, any help would be appreciated !
